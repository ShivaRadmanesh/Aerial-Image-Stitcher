# Aerial Photos Stitching
Given many aerial images of a civil structures at different times, find a mapping function between the images based on some common feature points to align the images and merge them as one.

The code is written in Python using the OpenCV library.

### **Example**
In the first image, you can see several images that comprise the program's input.

<img src="images/inputs.jpg">

The second image shows the program's output, which is the result of stitching all the input images together.
